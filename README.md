# Numerical-Linear-Algebra-Codes
Python implementation of various numerical linear algebra algorithms

* This code performs LU decomposition of a tridiagonal matrix given as input. The algorithm followed can ve found in the following link:[Algo][https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~barannyk/Teaching/LU_factorization_tridiagonal.pdf]
* FLOP count is (3n-3) since there are 3 operations - a division, multiplication and substraction.
